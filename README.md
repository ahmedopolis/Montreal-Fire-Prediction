The herein repository host the necessary assets for the data exploration, cleaning, integration, feature engineering and modelling for predicting fire-risk levels for the greater city of Montreal.

## Tools

A variety of tools and techniques were used in different steps of the project. Exploratory analysis was conducted using Python, Excel (pivot table), and Alteryx. Data cleaning, pre-processing, model development, and visualizations were primarily accomplished using Python (Jupyter notebook and libraries) and Tableau.
